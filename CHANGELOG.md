## [2.0.0-alpha.1] - 2026-04-19 (unreleased, `feature/k8s-v2` branch)

### Features (in progress)
- **Kubernetes mode (Week 1 of ~10)** — toggle Kubernetes support from Settings; reads kubeconfig from `$KUBECONFIG`, `~/.kube/config`, or a manual path set in the UI; "Test Connection" shows cluster version, node count, and namespace count
- **Kubeconfig-backed authentication** — credentials stay in the kubeconfig file (not DB); only the path is persisted, so security posture matches `kubectl` itself
- **Settings → Kubernetes tab** — mode toggle, kubeconfig path input, Test Connection button, and a hint for mounting `~/.kube` into the Docker container

### Technical Changes
- `server/k8s.js` — new Kubernetes client wrapper using `@kubernetes/client-node@0.22.x` (pinned to last CommonJS version; v1.x is ESM-only and would force the entire backend to ESM)
- `server/routes/k8s/cluster.js` — cluster info, contexts, namespaces; mode-guard middleware blocks access when Kubernetes mode is disabled
- `server/routes/k8s/setup.js` — kubeconfig-path, test, enable, disable; these endpoints work even when mode is off so the user can configure before enabling
- `server/index.js` — new route mounts at `/api/k8s-setup` and `/api/k8s/cluster`
- `server/db.js` — 3 new settings keys: `k8s_enabled`, `k8s_kubeconfig_path`, `k8s_active_context`
- `public/js/pages/settings.js` — new "Kubernetes" tab with mode toggle, path editor, live test result
- `package.json` — added `@kubernetes/client-node: ^0.22.3`

### Plan
Full 10-week roadmap: `docs/specs/k8s-v2-plan.md`. Week 2 ships Pods (list, inspect, delete, logs stream).

## [1.8.2] - 2026-04-19

### Bug Fixes
- **System Cleanup now matches UI counts** — clicking "Clean N Items" in the Cleanup page actually removes N items; previously only dangling (untagged) images were pruned while the UI counted all unused tagged images too, causing the cleanup action to appear to do nothing
- **Unused named volumes are now pruned** — on Docker 23+ `docker volume prune` defaulted to anonymous volumes only; DockGate now passes `all=true` filter so all unused volumes (named + anonymous) are cleared, matching what the UI displays
- **Full System Prune unified** — `systemPrune` uses the same filters so the Full Prune button's result matches the preview

### Technical Changes
- `server/docker.js` — `pruneImages` default `dangling=false` (all unused, not just dangling); `pruneVolumes` now passes `{ filters: { all: ['true'] } }`; `systemPrune` uses the same filters for both
- `server/routes/cleanup.js` — `/cleanup/images` query parameter flipped: default is now "prune all unused", opt-in `?dangling=true` for dangling-only

## [1.8.1] - 2026-04-16

### Features
- **Telegram Bot Notifications** — receive Docker alerts via Telegram alongside or instead of email, zero dependencies (native HTTPS)
- **Container Restart Notification** — alerts when a container restarts, shows restart count to detect restart loops
- **Container Unhealthy Notification** — alerts when a container's health check starts failing, with failing streak count and last health check output; detected both via Docker events and periodic 60s polling
- **Settings Tabbed Layout** — Settings page reorganized into 4 tabs: General, Notifications, Notification Log, Software Update

### Bug Fixes
- **Log Timestamps setting now works** — the toggle was saved but never passed to Docker; now `logs:subscribe` sends `timestamps: true` when enabled in settings

### Technical Changes
- `server/notifications/telegram.js` — new Telegram Bot API module using native `https`, `formatAlert()` for structured messages
- `server/notifications/event-monitor.js` — sends to both email and Telegram, 2 new event handlers (restart, unhealthy), periodic `_checkUnhealthy()` every 60s
- `server/notifications/templates.js` — 2 new HTML templates: `containerRestartTemplate`, `containerUnhealthyTemplate`
- `server/routes/settings.js` — 4 new Telegram endpoints: GET/POST/DELETE `/telegram`, POST `/telegram/test`
- `server/db.js` — 2 new default rules (`container_restart`, `container_unhealthy`), `channel` column on `notification_log`
- `public/js/pages/settings.js` — full rewrite with tab-bar (General, Notifications, Notification Log, Software Update), accordion channels
- `public/js/pages/container-detail.js` — passes `timestamps` setting to `logs:subscribe`
- `public/js/pages/logs.js` — passes `timestamps` setting to `logs:subscribe`

- **EventMonitor Service** — persistent Docker events stream listener with auto-reconnect, runs independently of frontend connections
- **Notification Rules** — per-event toggle (container_die, container_oom, disk_threshold, build_failed) with configurable cooldown (1-1440 minutes) to prevent email spam
- **Notification Log** — history of sent/failed emails viewable in Settings, auto-trimmed to 500 records
- **Test Email** — one-click SMTP test from Settings to verify configuration before relying on alerts
- **Email Templates** — professional HTML email templates for each alert type with DockGate branding

- `server/notifications/mailer.js` — SMTP transport via nodemailer, sendEmail with logging, sendTestEmail
- `server/notifications/templates.js` — 5 HTML email templates (containerDie, containerOom, diskAlert, buildFail, testEmail)
- `server/notifications/event-monitor.js` — EventMonitor class: Docker events stream, throttling, disk threshold check (5min interval), auto-reconnect on stream failure
- `server/routes/settings.js` — 7 new endpoints: SMTP CRUD, test email, notification rules CRUD, notification log
- `server/index.js` — EventMonitor starts on boot, build fail triggers notification, periodic notification log trim
- `public/js/pages/settings.js` — Notifications section: SMTP form, rule toggles with cooldown, recent notifications table

- **Container Stats UI redesign** — cleaner summary cards with separate lines for Network I/O (↓/↑) and Block I/O (R:/W:), `formatBytes()` on memory chart Y-axis, increased chart height

### Improvements
- **Chart CSS variable colors** — chart grid lines and tick labels now read from `--border` and `--text-muted` CSS variables via `getComputedStyle()`, ensuring proper rendering in both dark and light themes
- **Builds page stale render guards** — added `Router.isActiveNav()` checks after async API calls in `renderCache()`, `renderBuilders()`, and `renderBuildDetail()` to prevent stale page rendering
- **CSS hardcoded colors replaced** — all `rgba(255,255,255,...)` values across components, layout, and design-system replaced with CSS custom property references for full theme compatibility

### Technical Changes
- `public/css/design-system.css` — full `[data-theme="light"]` block with all color overrides, `--hover-bg` variable family (6 levels)
- `public/css/components.css` — buttons, tables, filters, toolbars, toggles now use CSS variables; light theme overrides for toasts, log-viewer, json-viewer, build-log-viewer, terminal-container
- `public/css/layout.css` — sidebar scrollbar, nav hover, header search, brand gradient use CSS variables
- `public/js/app.js` — `applyTheme()` function sets `data-theme` on `<html>`, boot-time theme load from localStorage
- `public/js/pages/settings.js` — theme dropdown "Light (Soon)" → "Light", calls `applyTheme()` on save

---

## [1.7.8] - 2026-04-15

### Bug Fixes
- **Docker Events stream fixed** — events page was always showing "Waiting for events..." because empty `filters: {}` was passed to Docker API, blocking the stream on some Docker versions
- **Event stream cleanup** — previous event stream is now destroyed before creating a new one on re-subscribe
- **Event error handling** — added `events:error` listener on frontend to show connection errors instead of silent failure

### Technical Changes
- `server/index.js` — `events:subscribe` handler no longer passes empty filters object, destroys previous stream on re-subscribe, emits errors on stream failure
- `public/js/pages/events.js` — added `events:error` socket listener with error display in empty state

---

## [1.7.7] - 2026-04-15

### Features

- **Bulk selection & deletion — Networks** — checkbox column (removable only, excludes bridge/host/none and in-use), select-all, bulk remove

### Bug Fixes
- **Navigation race condition fixed** — resolved issue where switching between pages (e.g., Images → Logs) could result in blank content or stale page rendering
- **Router navId guard** — added unique navigation ID counter to prevent in-flight async operations from overwriting the active page's content
- **All pages protected** — every page handler now checks `Router.isActiveNav()` after API calls to abort stale renders
- **Command injection fix** — compose routes now use `execFile` instead of `exec` with template literals, preventing shell injection via project names
- **WebSocket listener leak fix** — terminal `input`/`resize` listeners now cleaned up before re-registration on server side
- **Container Detail terminal resize leak** — `window.addEventListener('resize')` now properly removed in cleanup
- **Container Detail socket listener leak** — `terminal:ready` listener now tracked and removed with handler reference
- **Modal cleanup on navigation** — open modals are now closed when navigating between pages
- **Duplicate API call removed** — Containers page no longer makes a second API call just for counts
- **Toast notification limit** — max 5 toasts shown at once to prevent DOM bloat
- **Build cache prune** — uses `execFile` instead of `exec` for safer command execution
- **DB activity log retention** — activity limited to 1000 records, build history to 100, with periodic cleanup every 6h
- **DB indexes added** — indexes on `activity(resource_id, resource_type)`, `activity(created_at)`, `build_history(started_at)`
- **Compose project name validation** — only alphanumeric, dash, underscore allowed

### Technical Changes

## [1.7.3] - 2026-04-14

### Performance
- **Dashboard loads 3-5x faster** — removed `size:true` from `listContainers` (was forcing Docker to calculate disk usage per container)
- **Cache layer** — `getSystemInfo` (60s TTL) and `getDiskUsage` (30s TTL) results are now cached
- **Parallel stats + health** — container stats (CPU/RAM) and health inspect calls now run concurrently
- **Parallel compose projects** — `listComposeProjects` moved into Phase 1 parallel batch
- **Auto-refresh 15s → 30s** — halved Docker daemon load
- **Cache invalidation** — cache is automatically cleared after container actions

### Technical Changes
- `server/docker.js` — added `cached()` function and `invalidateCache()` utility
- `server/index.js` — dashboard endpoint restructured into 2-phase parallel architecture
- `public/js/pages/dashboard.js` — refresh interval 15000 → 30000ms

- **Port Map** — table of all exposed ports mapped to containers
- **Top Images by Size** — visual bar chart of largest Docker images
- **Quick Actions** — Start All / Stop All / Restart All buttons
- **Commit-based update detection** — every push triggers update notification, not just version changes

### Technical Changes
- `server/index.js` — dashboard API now returns containerStats, healthStats, containerDetails, portMap, topImages
- `public/js/pages/dashboard.js` — full rewrite with new sections and Chart.js doughnut
- `Dockerfile` — COMMIT_SHA build arg for update detection
- `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` — passes commit SHA to Docker build, lowercase image name fix

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-02

### New Features
- Version is now read from `package.json` everywhere — single source of truth
- Sidebar version display loads dynamically from `/api/meta/version` endpoint
- No more hardcoded version strings in HTML

### Technical Changes
- `server/routes/settings.js` — added `GET /meta/version` endpoint
- `public/js/app.js` — fetches version from API on boot, updates sidebar

---

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-02

### New Features
- Auto-update system with pre-built Docker image from GHCR (GitHub Container Registry)
- One-click update: pulls new image and restarts container automatically via helper container
- Settings page "Software Update" section: version comparison, changelog, update button
- Sidebar "UPDATE" badge when new version is available
- GitHub Actions CI/CD: auto-builds and pushes Docker image on every version tag, cleans up old untagged images

### How Auto-Update Works
- **Check**: Compares local version with GitHub `package.json` via `raw.githubusercontent.com` (no rate limits)
- **Apply**: Pulls `ghcr.io/ali7zeynalli/dockgate:latest` → inspects own container config → spawns `docker:cli` helper container → helper stops old container and starts new one with same config
- **Manual**: `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`

### Technical Changes
- `server/routes/settings.js` — complete rewrite: dockerode-based image pull + helper container restart (replaces broken git-based approach)
- `docker-compose.yml` — uses pre-built GHCR image instead of local build
- `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` — CI/CD pipeline: build, push to GHCR, cleanup old images
- `public/js/pages/settings.js` — update UI shows changelog instead of commits
- `public/js/app.js` — `checkForUpdates()` on boot + 24h interval with localStorage cache
- `README.md` — updated installation and update instructions (EN + AZ)
