# Changelog

---

## [2.0.49] - 2026-06-11

### Fixed — stable Swarm page (no flicker on SSH)
- The Swarm page no longer rebuilds the whole page on its 10s auto-refresh. Now it refreshes **only the active tab**, and **only touches the DOM when the data actually changed** — so the table no longer blinks, scroll position is kept, and row buttons stay responsive. This is most noticeable on a remote SSH host, where each refresh previously rebuilt everything over the slower SSH transport
- The Initialize-Swarm form is no longer re-rendered by the poll (your advertise-address input isn't cleared mid-typing)

---

## [2.0.48] - 2026-06-11

### Added — Compose & Swarm stacks now work on remote SSH hosts
- **Compose actions and `docker stack deploy` no longer require switching to Local.** When a remote SSH host is active, the host CLI is pointed at that daemon via `DOCKER_HOST=ssh://…` (using DockGate's stored key), so you can deploy/manage Compose projects and Swarm stacks on a remote host straight from the UI
- Compose: only **DockGate-managed** projects deploy remotely (the compose file lives on DockGate); private images still pull via stored registry credentials
- Requires a **key-based** SSH server **without a passphrase** (the SSH connection helper runs non-interactively); password/passphrase servers get a clear message to switch to Local. Bind-mount paths resolve on the remote host
- The Dockerfile now installs `openssh-client` for the remote CLI transport

> Verified end-to-end on a real remote host: created a Compose project + deployed a Swarm stack remotely, then tore them down — all from DockGate.

---

## [2.0.47] - 2026-06-11

### Improved
- **Network create form guides overlay use** — selecting the `overlay` driver now auto-enables **Attachable** and explains that it needs Swarm mode and spans the cluster. This is the network you create for swarm services (pairs with the service form, which now lists only overlay networks)

---

## [2.0.46] - 2026-06-11

### Fixed
- **Swarm service form only offers overlay networks now** — picking a local bridge network used to fail with `network ... cannot be used with services` (403). A service can only attach to a swarm-scoped **overlay** network, so the dropdown lists only those (with a hint to create one when there are none)
- **Removed the SSH "Connection troubleshooting" panel** from the Add-Server form (the Grant Docker button and the on-error hint already cover it)

---

## [2.0.45] - 2026-06-11

### Improved — in-app guidance for private images/repos
- Inline hints added where they're needed: **Pull Image** (use the full ref + add the registry first), **Compose editor** (private images pull automatically with a saved registry — no `docker login`), **New Build** (private `FROM` uses saved registry creds; private repos use the Git token field). Complements the existing GHCR hint on the Registries form

---

## [2.0.44] - 2026-06-11

### Added — one-click Docker access on remote servers
- **"Grant Docker access"** for SSH servers — a checkbox on the Add-Server form (runs it right after adding) and a per-server button. DockGate SSHes in and runs `sudo usermod -aG docker <user>` for you, so you don't have to do the stage-2 step manually. Requires the SSH user to have **passwordless sudo**; the action is audit-logged
- Runs in an isolated worker process so it never contends with the live event-monitor SSH connections

---

## [2.0.43] - 2026-06-11

### Added — Swarm node auto-join (zero manual commands)
- **Initialize Swarm on a remote SSH server now auto-advertises that server's host IP** — leave the advertise field blank and other VPSes can reach it (no more useless `127.0.0.1`)
- **Join-token address is corrected** — a loopback/empty advertise is replaced with the active server's host so the printed `docker swarm join` command is actually usable
- **One-click "Join a node"** — instead of copy-pasting a command, pick one of your DockGate SSH servers and a role (worker/manager); DockGate connects to that server and runs the join for you. Guarded when the manager only advertises a loopback address
- New endpoint `POST /api/swarm/nodes/join { serverId, role }`

> Firewall ports between nodes (`2377/tcp`, `7946/tcp+udp`, `4789/udp`) still have to be opened on your provider/host — DockGate can't do that for you.

---

## [2.0.42] - 2026-06-11

### Added — "P3" private registries & GitHub repos end-to-end
- **Builds can now pull private base images** — stored registry credentials are sent as the build's `X-Registry-Config`, so `FROM ghcr.io/you/private:tag` works in Git-context and inline-Dockerfile builds
- **Build from a private Git repo** — the New Build form has an optional **Git token** field (e.g. a GitHub PAT); it's embedded only into the clone URL handed to the daemon and is **never stored or logged** (the build history keeps the clean URL)
- **Compose can pull private images** — `docker compose up/pull/build` now runs with a generated `DOCKER_CONFIG` containing the stored registry credentials (previously compose ignored DockGate's registries and required a manual `docker login`)
- **Compose Build action** — a **Build** button per project runs `docker compose build` (for services with a `build:` section)

---

## [2.0.41] - 2026-06-11

### Added — "P2b" Swarm cross-module handoffs
When the active daemon is a swarm manager, Swarm entry points appear across the app:
- **Images** — a "Deploy as Swarm service" action on every image row (opens the service form prefilled)
- **Run Container modal** — a "**Deploy to Swarm →**" button that converts the filled form (image, name, ports, volumes, env, command) into the Swarm service form
- **Compose editor** — "**Deploy as Stack (Swarm)**" deploys the same YAML with `docker stack deploy`
- **App Templates** — stack templates get a one-click "**Swarm**" deploy (stack name prompt → `docker stack deploy`)

---

## [2.0.40] - 2026-06-11

### Added — "P2a" Swarm service form at full power
- **New Swarm Service form completely rebuilt** (now a shared module, `swarm-service-modal.js`) with every Run-Container convenience: **Docker Hub search**, local-image autocomplete, **image ENV-key suggestions**, row-based **ports** (with **udp**), row-based **mounts** with volume autocomplete + quick presets, **Paste .env** bulk import, command override
- **New swarm-only fields:** restart condition (any / on-failure / none), **overlay network** attach (service-to-service DNS), **CPU / memory limits** per replica, and **mount existing secrets & configs** into the service (dropdown + target path)
- Backend `createService` extended accordingly (RestartPolicy, Resources.Limits, TaskTemplate.Networks, SecretReference/ConfigReference)

---

## [2.0.39] - 2026-06-11

### Fixed — "P1" correctness & audit batch
- **Memory limit no longer disables swap** — Edit Resources used to set `MemorySwap = Memory` (which means *zero* swap). Now `MemorySwap = -1` (unlimited swap; only RAM is capped)
- **Audit log coverage** — 15+ previously-unlogged actions are now recorded: container **export** / **file download**, image **save**, volume **file download**, registry **credential test** (success *and* failed attempts), build history **hide/unhide/delete/clear**, notification-log clear, SMTP/Telegram tests, favorites/notes/tags changes. Settings changes now log **before → after** values
- **Swarm gating hardened** — every swarm endpoint now checks the node is a **manager** (workers got raw Docker errors before); service/node/secret/config mutations gate up-front with a clear 400
- **Secret/config size pre-validation** (500KB / 1000KB) with friendly errors
- **Leader node remove** is blocked with a clear message (demote first)
- **Helper-image errors** (volume backup/browse on air-gapped remote hosts) now explain the cause instead of an opaque failure

---

## [2.0.38] - 2026-06-11

### Fixed / Improved — "P0" quality batch
- **Cache-busting** — every JS/CSS asset URL in `index.html` is stamped with `?v=<version>` (server-side substitution). Browsers now pick up new code right after an update — no more hard-refresh to see new features
- **SSH server form** — the Add form now has a **key passphrase** field (it existed only in Edit before, so adding a server with an encrypted key always failed). Auth-failure messages now explain the two stages: *SSH login* ("All configured authentication methods failed" → user/key/passphrase) vs *Docker permission* (`usermod -aG docker`), with a matching troubleshooting panel
- **Swarm init form** — advertise-address hints: single host → `127.0.0.1`; multi-VPS → run init on that VPS (switch the active server) with *its own* public IP
- **Registries form** — GHCR how-to hint (PAT with `read:packages`, pull via full `ghcr.io/user/image:tag` ref)

---

## [2.0.37] - 2026-06-11

### Added — Swarm secrets & configs
- **Secrets & Configs tab** in Swarm — list, create (name + value, base64-encoded server-side) and remove swarm **secrets** (write-only) and **configs**. `GET/POST /api/swarm/secrets` · `DELETE /api/swarm/secrets/:id` · same for `/configs`

This completes the Swarm module: cluster bootstrap (init/join/leave/nodes), services (create/scale/update/logs/inspect/remove), stacks (deploy/remove), and secrets/configs.

---

## [2.0.36] - 2026-06-11

### Added — Swarm cluster bootstrap (multi-VPS)
- **Initialize Swarm** from the UI — turn a non-swarm host into a manager (with an optional advertise IP). No SSH needed. `POST /api/swarm/init`
- **Join a node** — shows the ready-to-run `docker swarm join` commands (worker & manager) plus the required firewall ports, so you can add other VPSes to the cluster. `GET /api/swarm/jointokens`
- **Leave Swarm** — `POST /api/swarm/leave`
- **Remove node** — drop a node from the cluster (Nodes tab). `DELETE /api/swarm/nodes/:id`

> Point DockGate at a manager node (Local or an SSH server) and it manages the whole multi-VPS cluster — every node, service and stack — from one place.

---

## [2.0.35] - 2026-06-11

### Added — Swarm stacks
- **Stacks tab** in Swarm — list stacks (grouped by the `com.docker.stack.namespace` label, works on any active daemon), drill into a stack's **services**, **Deploy** a stack by pasting a compose file (`docker stack deploy`, local host), and **Remove** a stack. `GET /api/swarm/stacks` · `POST /api/swarm/stacks/deploy` · `DELETE /api/swarm/stacks/:name`
- Deploy/remove are local-host operations (use the host CLI, like Compose); listing works against the active daemon

---

## [2.0.34] - 2026-06-11

### Added — Swarm service management (filling the gaps)
- **Create Service** — a New Service form (name, image, replicas, ports, mounts, env) deploys a replicated service. `POST /api/swarm/services`
- **Rolling update** — change a service's image (triggers a swarm rolling update). `POST /api/swarm/services/:id/update`
- **Service logs** — view a service's aggregated logs across replicas. `GET /api/swarm/services/:id/logs`
- **Service inspect** — raw service spec in a modal. `GET /api/swarm/services/:id`
- All mutations are written to the Audit Log (create / update / scale / remove)

> Publishing ports on a service requires the swarm's ingress network (present on a normal `docker swarm init`).

---

## [2.0.33] - 2026-06-11

### Added — Docker Swarm
- **Swarm page** (Orchestration group) — manage the active daemon when it's a swarm manager:
  - **Services** — list (name, image, mode, replicas, ports), **scale** replicated services, view **tasks** (per-replica state), remove
  - **Nodes** — list (hostname, role, state, availability, leader), set availability (**activate** / **drain**)
  - Gracefully shows "not in swarm mode" when the host isn't a manager. Uses the same dockerode client + SSH Proxy, so it works on remote hosts too
- New endpoints under `/api/swarm` (`/`, `/services`, `/services/:id`, `/services/:id/scale`, `/services/:id/tasks`, `/nodes`, `/nodes/:id/availability`)

---

## [2.0.32] - 2026-06-10

### Changed
- **System info moved into Settings** — the "System" page is no longer a sidebar item; it's now a **System** tab under Settings (engine version, OS, drivers, raw Docker API inspect). Keeps the sidebar focused on day-to-day actions

---

## [2.0.31] - 2026-06-10

### Added — "L3" inline build
- **Inline Dockerfile build** — the New Build dialog now has a **Git/URL** vs **Inline Dockerfile** toggle; paste/type a Dockerfile (no Git context needed) and DockGate builds it from a generated tar context
- **Build from this** on the Images page — opens the build dialog with `FROM <image>` pre-filled, so you can extend an image into a new one (the practical answer to "edit an image", since image layers are immutable)

---

## [2.0.30] - 2026-06-10

### Added — "L3" container file browser
- **Files tab** in Container Detail — browse the container's filesystem, **download** files, and **copy in** (upload a `.tar` that's extracted at the current path). Uses `docker cp`-style `exec` / `putArchive` (running containers). `GET /api/containers/:id/files` · `GET /api/containers/:id/file` · `POST /api/containers/:id/upload`

---

## [2.0.29] - 2026-06-10

### Added — "L3" volume file browser
- **Browse a volume's files** — navigate directories and download individual files, served by a read-only helper container. Path traversal is blocked (`../` is stripped). `GET /api/volumes/:name/files?path=` · `GET /api/volumes/:name/file?path=`

---

## [2.0.28] - 2026-06-10

### Added — "L3" volume restore
- **Restore a volume** from an uploaded `.tar.gz` (the inverse of Backup) — a helper container extracts the streamed upload into the volume, completing the backup ⇄ restore round-trip. `POST /api/volumes/:name/restore`

---

## [2.0.27] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed
- **App Templates now auto-load the big catalog** — previously an empty/unset `template_url` showed only the bundled ~15. Now empty = the **default community catalog (500+ apps)**, fetched automatically (falls back to bundled if offline). To force the offline set, pick **Bundled (offline only)** in the Source picker (sets the sentinel `bundled`). This fixes instances that had the source cleared during testing

---

## [2.0.26] - 2026-06-10

### Improved
- **Network create form auto-suggests networking** — opening **New Network** (or **Clone**) now pre-fills a **free** private subnet, gateway and IP range (scanning existing networks to avoid overlaps), with a **↻ Suggest** button to cycle to the next free range. No more typing CIDRs by hand
- The driver list stays bridge / macvlan / ipvlan / overlay — `host` and `none` are Docker's built-in singleton networks and **cannot be created** (so they're intentionally not offered)

---

## [2.0.25] - 2026-06-10

### Added — "L2" images
- **Save** an image to a `.tar` download (`docker save`). `GET /api/images/:id/save`
- **Load** images from an uploaded `.tar` (`docker load`) — air-gap transfer. `POST /api/images/load` (streamed, no buffering)

> "Build from this image" (I3) is deferred to a later release — the build pipeline currently only accepts a Git/URL context, so it needs inline-Dockerfile build support first.

---

## [2.0.24] - 2026-06-10

### Added — "L2" volumes
- **New Volume** — a create form (name, driver, driver options, labels). The Volumes page had no create UI before
- **Backup** — download a volume's contents as a `.tar.gz` (a throwaway helper container mounts it read-only and streams the tar). `GET /api/volumes/:name/backup`
- **Clone** — copy a volume's data into a new volume (helper container `cp -a`). `POST /api/volumes/:name/clone`

> Volumes can't be relocated in Docker, so **clone** (copy to a new volume) is the practical equivalent. Restore-from-upload is planned for a later (L3) release.

---

## [2.0.23] - 2026-06-10

### Added — "L2" networks
- **New Network** — a rich create form (driver: bridge / macvlan / ipvlan / overlay, subnet, gateway, IP range, internal, attachable, IPv6). The Networks page had no create UI before
- **Clone** an existing network — prefills the create form from its config (a network's driver/subnet are immutable, so cloning to a new network is the real "edit")

---

## [2.0.22] - 2026-06-10

### Added — "L2" container actions
- **Edit Resources** — change a container's CPU / memory limits and restart policy live (`docker update`). `POST /api/containers/:id/update`
- **Recreate** — rebuild a container with (optionally) a new image while preserving its config (env, ports, volumes, networks); volume data is kept, secondary networks are re-attached. The "update an app" flow. `POST /api/containers/:id/recreate`
- **Commit** — save a container's current state as a new image. `POST /api/containers/:id/commit`

---

## [2.0.21] - 2026-06-10

### Added — "L1" page features
- **Networks**
  - **Connect / disconnect a container** to/from a network, live, from the inspect modal (which now also shows subnet & gateway). Networks themselves are immutable in Docker, so this membership control is the real "edit". `POST /api/networks/:id/connect` · `POST /api/networks/:id/disconnect`
- **Images**
  - **Layers / history** viewer (each layer's command + size). `GET /api/images/:id/history`
  - **Tag management** — add a tag or untag a specific reference. `POST /api/images/untag`
- **Container detail**
  - New **Processes** tab — live process list (`top`) + a **one-off command** runner. `GET /api/containers/:id/top` · `POST /api/containers/:id/exec`
  - **Export** the container filesystem as a `.tar` download. `GET /api/containers/:id/export`
  - **Healthcheck** detail in Overview (status, failing streak, last check outputs)
  - **Connect / disconnect networks** directly from the Network tab

---

## [2.0.20] - 2026-06-10

### Changed
- **Compose guided "Add service" is now row-based** — the ports, volumes and environment inputs use the same repeatable-row UX as the Run Container modal: per-row fields, volume host autocomplete (existing volumes) + presets (docker.sock / ./data / ./config), **Paste .env** bulk import, and image-declared env-key suggestions. The service block is still generated into the editable YAML. The editor's action button also moved to the sticky modal footer

---

## [2.0.19] - 2026-06-10

### Added
- **Faster volume & environment entry** in the Run Container modal:
  - **Volumes** — the host field autocompletes from your existing Docker volumes (datalist), plus quick-preset buttons (**docker.sock**, **./data**, **./config**) that drop in a prefilled volume row
  - **Environment** — a **Paste .env** panel bulk-imports `KEY=VALUE` lines (handles `#` comments, `export `, and quotes) into individual env rows; the env KEY field also suggests the selected **local** image's declared variables (read from its `Config.Env`)
- The Compose guided "Add service" panel gets the same **volume presets** and **Paste .env** import (adapted to its comma-separated fields)
- Shared `parseDotEnv()` helper underpins both

---

## [2.0.18] - 2026-06-10

### Added
- **Search Docker Hub** — the Run Container modal and the Images "Pull Image" dialog now have a **Search Docker Hub** button. It opens a live search (repository name, description, star count, official badge); picking a result fills the image field (and ticks "pull" in the Run modal). Backed by a new `GET /api/images/search?q=` endpoint that proxies the Docker Hub search API server-side (the Hub API isn't reachable from the browser due to CORS)
  - Note: *pulling* from Docker Hub already worked by typing any image name — this adds **discovery/search** so you don't have to know the exact name

---

## [2.0.17] - 2026-06-10

### Changed
- **App Templates now shows a large catalog out of the box** — the default source is the community **500+** Portainer-format catalog (databases, web apps, tools — overlapping what Portainer and Coolify offer). It loads automatically; if offline it falls back to the bundled ~14. A **Source** picker (Bundled / Portainer Official / Community 500+ / custom URL) lets you switch or go fully offline

### Fixed
- **Modals now fit the screen** — modals use a flex layout so the header and action footer stay fixed while only the body scrolls. Tall modals (Run Container, Compose editor) no longer overflow the viewport, and the primary action button is always visible (the Run button moved into a sticky footer)
- **No more horizontal scrolling in the Run Container modal** — the port / volume / env rows now shrink correctly (`.input` gets `min-width: 0`), so adding rows no longer pushes the modal sideways. Same fix also tidies the multi-column server-edit form

---

## [2.0.16] - 2026-06-10

### Added
- **App Templates** — a new marketplace page (Build → App Templates) with a searchable, category-filterable catalog of ready-to-deploy apps in the Portainer "App Templates" v2 format. Click **Deploy**:
  - a **container** template prefills the Run Container modal (image, name, ports, volumes, env, pull)
  - a **stack** template prefills the Compose editor with its `docker-compose.yml`, ready to create & up
- **Bundled catalog** — ships with ~14 curated apps (nginx, postgres, redis, mysql, mongo, grafana, adminer, Uptime Kuma, WordPress+MySQL, Nextcloud+PostgreSQL, …) that work fully offline
- **Configurable source** — Settings key `template_url`: point it at a Portainer-format catalog URL (e.g. a community list) to load 100+ apps; blank uses the bundled set. Remote catalogs are cached and fall back to the bundled set if unreachable
- New endpoints: `GET /api/templates`, `GET /api/templates/stackfile?url=` (server-side proxy, http(s) only)

### Changed
- The Compose editor (New Project / Edit YAML) is now a shared global (`public/js/compose-editor.js`) so the Templates page can reuse it; `openRunContainerModal()` now also accepts a full prefill object (image + ports + volumes + env). No change to existing behaviour

---

## [2.0.15] - 2026-06-10

### Added
- **Edit registered SSH servers from the UI** — each remote server in Settings → Servers now has an **Edit** button that opens a modal to change host, port, username, description, or auth (private key / password). Leaving the key/password blank keeps the current secret; a **Test Connection** verifies the saved server or the new credentials. (The `PUT /api/servers/:id` endpoint already existed — this wires up the front-end.)

### Changed
- **Display timezone now applies everywhere** — the timestamps on Volume detail, Builds (history/detail), Container detail (Created/Started/Finished), and the Notification Log now honour the timezone selected in Settings → General, instead of always using the browser's local time

### Fixed / Security
- **Secrets no longer leak into the audit log** — when a container is created with environment variables, the audit record now masks the values (`DB_PASSWORD=***`) instead of storing them in plain text (which also flowed into the CSV export). Keys are kept, values are redacted

---

## [2.0.14] - 2026-06-10

### Added
- **Private registry credentials** — a new **Registries** page (under Manage) to store and manage credentials for private image registries (ghcr.io, GitLab, Docker Hub private, self-hosted, …). Add / edit / delete, plus a **Test login** that verifies the credentials against the registry before saving. Passwords are never sent back to the browser (masked)
- **Automatic authentication on pull** — stored credentials are matched to an image by its registry host, so pulling a private image now works everywhere it already worked for public images: the Images "Pull", the **Run Container** modal, and the `/run` pull-on-missing path — no code change needed at the call sites
- **Push images to a registry** — `POST /api/images/push` pushes a tagged local image to its registry, authenticating with the matching stored credential
- New endpoints: `GET/POST /api/registries`, `PUT/DELETE /api/registries/:id`, `POST /api/registries/test`

### Notes
- Credentials are stored in the local SQLite database (same trust model as the existing SSH server passwords — protected by the `data/` volume on the host; DockGate is self-hosted, single-user)

---

## [2.0.13] - 2026-06-02

### Changed
- **CI:** bumped `actions/checkout` and `actions/setup-node` from `@v4` to `@v6` — both now run on the Node 24 runtime, clearing GitHub's Node 20 deprecation warning (Node 20 actions are force-migrated on 2026-06-16). No change to application code or behaviour

---

## [2.0.12] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- **Run Container** — a guided form to launch a container from an image (Containers header "Run Container" button + a per-image "Run" action on the Images page): image with autocomplete + optional pull, name, repeatable port / volume / env rows, restart policy, network, command override, CPU / memory limits. `POST /api/containers/run` pulls-if-missing → creates → starts. Runs on the active host (local or remote SSH)
- **Create & edit Compose projects in the UI** — Compose page "New Project" + per-project "Edit YAML": a raw `docker-compose.yml` editor plus a guided "Add service" builder (name / image / ports / volumes / env → generated YAML). `POST /api/compose/create`, `GET` / `PUT /api/compose/:project/file`; the file is written under `data/compose/<project>/`, validated with `docker compose config`, then brought up. Local host only

### Fixed
- A fully-down Compose project created by DockGate can now be brought back up — the up/down/restart/pull actions fall back to the managed `data/compose/<project>` directory when the working dir can no longer be read from container labels

---

## [2.0.11] - 2026-06-02

A front-end reliability & UX release driven by a per-page audit of refresh behaviour and buttons.

### Fixed
- **Bulk actions no longer hide failures** — Start/Stop/Restart/Remove (Containers, Dashboard quick actions, Images, Volumes, Networks, Builds) used to swallow every per-item error and always show "success". They now report an accurate result (e.g. "Removed: 3 OK, 1 failed — &lt;reason&gt;") via a shared `bulkRun` helper
- **Real-time streams recover after a reconnect** — Logs, Stats, Events and Terminal silently froze when the socket reconnected (the server had dropped the stream). They now re-subscribe on reconnect and surface stream `error`/`end` notices instead of hanging
- **Image build is attributed to the correct host** — a build run while a remote SSH host is active is now audited and its failure alert routed to that host (was hardcoded "local")
- **Terminal reports its size to the server** — `terminal:resize` is now emitted so the remote shell wraps correctly (previously only the local xterm was resized)
- **Inspect "Search JSON" works** — the container-detail Inspect search box had no handler (dead UI); it now filters the JSON
- **Dashboard Smart Insights are clickable** — insight cards with a cleanup action now navigate to Cleanup
- **System page** — removed a dead, unused `/system/df` fetch that also made the page fail if `df` errored
- **Settings** — saving SMTP / Telegram now refreshes the view so the configured/masked state shows immediately
- **Images** — registry tags with a port (e.g. `localhost:5000/app:1.0`) now parse correctly (split on the last colon)
- **Clipboard copy** — Inspect JSON and build-log copy show a clear message instead of failing silently outside HTTPS/localhost

### Added
- **Consistent auto-refresh** — Volumes, Networks, System and Compose now auto-refresh (with the same modal/input-focus guard as Dashboard/Containers/Images); Networks also gained its missing cleanup-on-navigation

### Changed
- **Compose** — Down/Restart now ask for confirmation (destructive), and the actions are disabled with a notice when a remote SSH host is active (Compose is local-only)
- Container events table now escapes the type/action fields

---

## [2.0.10] - 2026-06-02

### Security
- **Resolved the transitive `uuid` advisory (GHSA-w5hq-g745-h8pq)** — `npm audit` is now clean (0 vulnerabilities). `dockerode` was upgraded to 5.x, which drops the vulnerable `uuid` dependency (it uses `crypto.randomUUID`). The upgrade was verified non-breaking for DockGate: it still uses `docker-modem` 5.0.7, so SSH multi-host (key auth), build-cache prune and all container/image/volume/network operations work against a real remote host, and the full test suite passes. (The advisory was not exploitable here regardless — dockerode only called `uuid.v4()` with no buffer, and DockGate itself uses `crypto.randomUUID`.)

### Changed
- Dependency ranges in `package.json` now match the installed versions: `better-sqlite3` ^11.10.0, `dockerode` ^5.0.0, `express` ^4.22.2, `socket.io` ^4.8.3, `node-pty` ^1.1.0

---

## [2.0.9] - 2026-06-02

### Fixed
- **Build Cache prune now works on remote SSH hosts** — "Clear Cache" (Builds page and System Cleanup) used the host `docker builder prune` CLI, so it only worked on the local daemon and failed on a remote host. It now uses the Docker Engine API (`pruneBuilder` → `POST /build/prune`) via dockerode, which tunnels over SSH. Verified against a real remote host holding 44.5 GB of build cache. The rest of the Builds / Cleanup data (build history, image-layer history, disk usage, container/image/volume/network prune) already used the Engine API and works on remote once the v2.0.8 SSH fix is deployed

### Notes
- **Builders list (buildx)** on a remote host shows only the default builder — `docker buildx ls` is a local CLI plugin with no Engine API equivalent, so a remote daemon's buildx builders cannot be enumerated (Docker limitation, not a DockGate bug)
- **Compose up/down/restart/pull** remain local-only — they require the compose files on the host filesystem

---

## [2.0.8] - 2026-06-02

### Fixed
- **SSH key authentication now works — it was completely broken** — connecting to a remote host with a **private key** always failed with `All configured authentication methods failed`, even with valid credentials. Root cause: `docker-modem` 5.x forwards only `host` / `port` / `username` / `password` to `ssh2` at the top level, while `privateKey` / `passphrase` must be passed inside `sshOptions`. DockGate set them at the top level, so they were silently dropped and `ssh2` fell back to the (absent) SSH agent. Both the active client (`createSshClient`) and the per-host event monitor (`buildClient`) now pass the key/passphrase via `sshOptions`. Verified end-to-end against a real remote host (add → switch → list remote containers). Password auth was unaffected (docker-modem forwards `password` at the top level)

---

## [2.0.7] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- **Automated test suite** — the project's first tests, run with `npm test` (Node's built-in test runner, no extra runtime deps; `supertest` as a dev dependency only):
  - **Unit** — `parseStats` / `demuxLogs` (Docker stats & log demux), source-IP extraction (`ipFromReq` / `ipFromSocket`)
  - **Integration** — the `/api/meta` routes against an isolated temp DB (no Docker daemon): settings allow-list (rejects `active_server`), timezone persistence, audit logging with server + source IP, audit search/filter, facets, and log clearing
- **CI test gate** — GitHub Actions now runs `npm ci && npm test` and the image build only proceeds when tests pass
- **`DATA_DIR` env override** — lets tests (and custom deploys) point the SQLite database at an isolated directory

---

## [2.0.6] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- **Display timezone** — a new **Timezone** setting (Settings → General) lets you pick any IANA zone (or **Auto** = browser/host); all displayed dates and notification timestamps render in the chosen zone. Previously everything showed **UTC** because the container runs in UTC. Stored times stay UTC — only the display is converted

### Changed
- Centralized front-end time formatting in a `formatTime()` helper and made `timeAgo`'s absolute fallback timezone-aware; container / build event email & Telegram notifications now format their timestamps in the selected timezone

---

## [2.0.5] - 2026-06-02

Adds a full audit log so you can see what was done on DockGate, on which host, and from where. Also makes the in-app audit search cover every column and standardizes all in-code comments and UI strings to English.

### Added
- **Audit Log** — every mutating operation is now recorded with its **host (server)** and **source IP** context: container/image/volume/network actions, Compose, cleanup/prune, image builds, interactive terminal sessions (session-level — keystrokes are not logged), SMTP/Telegram/notification-rule changes, settings changes, server add/edit/delete/switch, and self-update. Since there is no auth, this is a "what was done + from where" trail, not "who did it"
- **Audit Log page** (sidebar → Monitor → Audit Log) — filter by server / type / action, full-text search, adjustable row limit, and **CSV export**
- **`GET /api/meta/activity`** filtering (`type`, `action`, `server`, `q`, `limit`) and **`GET /api/meta/activity/facets`** for filter dropdown values
- `server/audit.js` — central `logAction()` helper that auto-captures the active server and source IP; the `activity` table gains `server` and `source_ip` columns
- **`trust proxy`** is enabled so the recorded source IP is correct behind a reverse proxy

### Fixed
- **Audit search now covers every column** — the search box matches resource, details, action, **server, source IP and type** (previously only resource/details/action, so searching by IP, server or type returned nothing)

### Changed
- **English everywhere** — all in-code comments and the Audit Log UI strings are now in English, matching the rest of the project

---

## [2.0.4] - 2026-06-02

A correctness-and-hardening release driven by a full-codebase audit. Fixes a class of multi-host bugs where local-only operations silently targeted (or failed against) the wrong daemon, repairs SSH key-passphrase support end to end, makes notifications honest, adds server editing, and bundles all front-end dependencies locally for air-gapped installs.

### Fixed
- **SSH key passphrase now persists** — the `servers` table gained a `passphrase` column; `POST /api/servers` and the new `PUT` accept and store it, and both the active-client (`createSshClient`) and the per-host `EventMonitor` (`monitor-manager.js`) apply it. Previously an encrypted key passed *Test Connection* but failed on activation (and produced no notifications) because the passphrase was never saved
- **Self-update & auto-start always act on the local host** — `POST /api/meta/update/apply` and the autostart toggle now use a dedicated local Docker client instead of the active (possibly remote) proxy. Before, triggering an update while a remote SSH host was active made DockGate look for its own container on the *remote* daemon and spawn the helper there
- **Build success/failure detection** — status is now derived from the Docker stream's structured `error`/`errorDetail` field instead of grepping the log text for `ERROR:` (which mis-flagged successful builds whose output happened to contain that string); the real error message is passed to the build-failed notification
- **Notification accuracy** — a clean container stop (exit 0) no longer says "stopped **unexpectedly**" (the alert now distinguishes *Stopped* from *Crashed*); an OOM kill (exit 137) sends a single OOM alert instead of OOM **and** a generic "stopped" alert; the disk-threshold alert reports honest absolute volumes (`X GB used / 50 GB threshold`) instead of a misleading GB-as-percent figure that always pinned at 100%
- **Stale disk/usage after deletes** — `removeImage/removeVolume/removeNetwork`, all `prune*` calls and the create operations now invalidate the cache, so the dashboard's disk usage and counters refresh immediately (previously only container actions did)
- **Front-end port links are host-aware** — published-port links now point at the active server's host (or the browser's host for local) instead of a hard-coded `localhost`, so they work when a remote SSH host is selected
- **Toast messages are escaped** — backend error text containing `< > &` no longer breaks toast rendering (`textContent` instead of `innerHTML`)
- **Settings no longer reset on hard refresh** — the Settings page short-circuited on the store's initial `{}` (which is truthy), so a full reload rendered every General-tab control (Log Timestamps, Default View, Default Shell) from empty state instead of fetching the saved values. It now fetches from the server when the store cache is empty

### Added
- **Edit existing servers** — `PUT /api/servers/:id` updates host/port/username/key/password/passphrase/description (only the fields sent change); it refreshes the active client and restarts the host's monitor. Previously editing required delete-and-recreate
- **Air-gapped support** — Socket.IO, Chart.js, xterm.js (+ fit addon) and the Inter / JetBrains Mono fonts are now bundled under `public/vendor/` and served locally; no CDN or internet access is required at runtime
- **`POST /api/meta/settings` key allow-list** — only known UI settings are writable; `active_server` is rejected so it can only change through `POST /api/servers/active` (prevents DB ↔ active-client state drift)

### Changed
- **Self-update preserves more config** — labels and custom networks are now carried over to the recreated container (in addition to ports, volumes, env, restart policy and resource limits)
- **Multi-host CLI guards** — operations that shell out to the host Docker CLI (Compose up/down/restart/pull, `buildx ls`, build-cache prune) now return a clear error when a remote SSH host is active, instead of silently acting on the local machine
- **`docker-history` parallelised** — per-image `history()` calls now run concurrently (`Promise.all`) instead of sequentially
- **Auto-refresh respects interaction** — Dashboard / Containers / Images skip their periodic re-render while a modal is open or an input is focused, preventing lost focus and scroll position
- **Docker image is multi-stage** — native modules are compiled in a builder stage with `npm ci` (reproducible, lock-file driven); the final runtime image drops the build toolchain (python3/make/g++) and keeps only the Docker CLI, shrinking the image
- **DB migrations are quieter but not silent** — additive `ALTER`/retention statements log genuine errors via `console.warn` while still ignoring expected "duplicate column" noise

### Removed
- **Dead code** — unused `streamEvents`, `streamContainerStats`, `streamContainerLogs` and `execInContainer` helpers were removed from `server/docker.js` (real-time streaming is built directly in `server/index.js`; the duplicates risked divergence)

---

## [2.0.3] - 2026-05-07

### Features — Multi-host Notifications
Notifications now fire from **every registered server simultaneously**, not just the active one. If you flip the header dropdown to `prod-1` and a container dies on `local`, the alert still arrives.

- **Per-server EventMonitor** — `EventMonitor` now takes a `(serverId, dockerClient)` pair; the docker client is dedicated (not the active-server proxy), so the stream stays bound to its own daemon
- **MonitorManager** (`server/notifications/monitor-manager.js`) — owns one `EventMonitor` per registered server (local + every SSH host); auto-starts on boot, auto-spawns when a server is added via `POST /api/servers`, auto-stops when one is deleted
- **Server-aware cooldown** — the throttle key now includes both server id and resource id (e.g. `prod-1:container_die:nginx`), so the same crash on different hosts each get an alert, and one host crashlooping doesn't suppress alerts from another
- **Server prefix in subject + Telegram + email** — alerts from non-local hosts include `[prod-1]` in the subject line, a `Server` row in the email body, and a `Server` field in the Telegram message; local-server alerts stay clean (no prefix)
- **Build-failed stays local** — image builds run against the host Docker, so the build-failure trigger is routed through the local monitor only

### Technical Changes
- `server/notifications/event-monitor.js` — class now constructor-injected with `serverId` and `docker`; reconnect logic respects `stopped` flag so a stop-followed-by-restart doesn't leak a pending reconnect; cooldown map keyed per `(serverId, eventType, resourceKey)`
- `server/notifications/monitor-manager.js` (new) — `startMonitor(idOrConfig)`, `stopMonitor(id)`, `startAll()`, `stopAll()`, `getLocal()`, `listMonitors()`; reads SSH key files into memory when constructing the dedicated client
- `server/notifications/templates.js` — every container/disk template now accepts an optional `server` field and emits a `Server` row when present (skipped for `local`)
- `server/index.js` — startup now calls `monitorManager.startAll()` instead of a single `eventMonitor.start()`; build-failure callback uses `monitorManager.getLocal()` because builds are local-only
- `server/routes/servers.js` — `POST /api/servers` calls `monitorManager.startMonitor(id)` after insert; `DELETE /api/servers/:id` calls `monitorManager.stopMonitor(id)` before responding

---

## [2.0.2] - 2026-05-07

### UX
- **SSH Agent tab marked as "Coming Soon"** — the agent path works in code (ssh2 falls back to `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`), but the DockGate container doesn't mount the host's agent socket out-of-the-box, so the connection fails for most users. Until the docker-compose mount is wired up, the tab now shows a clear "Coming Soon" badge plus an inline note pointing users to Private Key or Password instead

---

## [2.0.1] - 2026-05-07

### Major — Multi-host SSH Support
DockGate now manages **multiple Docker daemons** at once: the local socket plus any number of remote SSH servers. A compact **SRV** dropdown in the header switches between them; every page (Containers, Images, Volumes, Networks, Compose, Logs, Terminal) automatically reflects the active server.

### Features
- **SSH server registration** — Settings → Servers tab; add a host with ID, address, port, username, and one of three auth methods
- **Three SSH authentication methods:**
  - 🔑 **Private Key** — paste OpenSSH-format key; saved to `data/ssh-keys/<id>.pem` with mode 0600
  - 🔒 **Password** — stored as plain text in the DB (file-system protected via the data volume); UI uses a password input plus a "Private Key is more secure" hint
  - 📡 **SSH Agent** — no credentials supplied; `ssh2` falls back to `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`
- **Test Connection** — verifies a configuration before saving (or for an existing server) by running `dockerode` over SSH and reporting Docker version, container count, and image count
- **Header SRV dropdown** — shows `🖥 Local` plus every registered SSH host; changing the selection re-navigates the current page so the new daemon's data loads in place
- **Active-server persistence** — the choice is stored as the `active_server` setting and restored on container restart
- **Auth-mode badges** in the server table — each row shows 🔑 key / 🔒 password / 📡 agent at a glance

### Architecture — Dynamic Docker Client
- `server/docker.js` keeps a single runtime variable `_docker`; `setActiveServer(id)` reads the server config and rebuilds the client (`createLocalClient()` or `createSshClient()`)
- The exported `docker` is a `Proxy` whose getter forwards every property access to the current `_docker`. This means **none of the existing routes had to change** — every `dockerService.docker.X(...)` call automatically reaches the active daemon
- Dockerode's `protocol: 'ssh'` is used (handled by the `ssh2` library bundled with dockerode), so we get SSH tunneling without managing tunnels ourselves
- Auth precedence inside `createSshClient()`: privateKey → password → agent (ssh2 fallback)

### Technical Changes
- `server/db.js` — new `servers` table (id, type, host, port, username, key_path, password, description, created_at) plus five prepared statements; `active_server` added to the default settings; `ALTER TABLE` migration adds `password` column on existing installs
- `server/docker.js` — adds `setActiveServer()`, `getActiveServerId()`, `testServerConnection()`, plus `createLocalClient()` / `createSshClient()` helpers; the cache is cleared on every switch
- `server/routes/servers.js` — new router: `GET/POST/DELETE /api/servers`, `POST /test`, `POST /active`
- `server/index.js` — restores the saved `active_server` on startup; raises the Express JSON body limit to 5 MB so pasted private keys fit
- `public/index.html` — compact SRV switcher in the header
- `public/js/app.js` — `initServerSwitcher()` populates the dropdown via DOM APIs (XSS-safe escaping for user-supplied host strings) and re-navigates the current page on switch
- `public/js/pages/settings.js` — new "Servers" tab with the server table, a three-tab Add form (Private Key / Password / SSH Agent), inline test result, and a remote-host setup hint

### Migration
- Nothing required for v1.x users — `active_server` defaults to `local`, behaviour is unchanged
- To start using the new feature: Settings → Servers → Add SSH Server

### Security Notes
- Private-key files are written with mode `0600` (owner read-only)
- The `data/ssh-keys/` directory is created with mode `0700` inside the container
- DockGate itself has no built-in auth — anyone who can reach the UI can add or modify servers; **do not expose to untrusted networks**
- SSH key files are owned by the DockGate process user (`node` inside the container)
- Test-connection key files use temporary names (`_test_<timestamp>.pem`) and are deleted when the test completes, regardless of outcome

---

## [1.8.2] - 2026-04-19

### Bug Fixes
- **System Cleanup now matches UI counts** — clicking "Clean N Items" in the Cleanup page actually removes N items; previously only dangling (untagged) images were pruned while the UI counted all unused tagged images too, causing the cleanup action to appear to do nothing
- **Unused named volumes are now pruned** — on Docker 23+ `docker volume prune` defaulted to anonymous volumes only; DockGate now passes `all=true` filter so all unused volumes (named + anonymous) are cleared, matching what the UI displays
- **Full System Prune unified** — `systemPrune` uses the same filters so the Full Prune button's result matches the preview

### Technical Changes
- `server/docker.js` — `pruneImages` default `dangling=false` (all unused, not just dangling); `pruneVolumes` now passes `{ filters: { all: ['true'] } }`; `systemPrune` uses the same filters for both
- `server/routes/cleanup.js` — `/cleanup/images` query parameter flipped: default is now "prune all unused", opt-in `?dangling=true` for dangling-only

---

## [1.8.1] - 2026-04-16

### Features
- **Telegram Bot Notifications** — receive Docker alerts via Telegram alongside or instead of email, zero dependencies (native HTTPS)
- **Container Restart Notification** — alerts when a container restarts, shows restart count to detect restart loops
- **Container Unhealthy Notification** — alerts when a container's health check starts failing, with failing streak count and last health check output; detected both via Docker events and periodic 60s polling
- **Settings Tabbed Layout** — Settings page reorganized into 4 tabs: General, Notifications, Notification Log, Software Update

### Bug Fixes
- **Log Timestamps setting now works** — the toggle was saved but never passed to Docker; now `logs:subscribe` sends `timestamps: true` when enabled in settings

### Technical Changes
- `server/notifications/telegram.js` — new Telegram Bot API module using native `https`, `formatAlert()` for structured messages
- `server/notifications/event-monitor.js` — sends to both email and Telegram, 2 new event handlers (restart, unhealthy), periodic `_checkUnhealthy()` every 60s
- `server/notifications/templates.js` — 2 new HTML templates: `containerRestartTemplate`, `containerUnhealthyTemplate`
- `server/routes/settings.js` — 4 new Telegram endpoints: GET/POST/DELETE `/telegram`, POST `/telegram/test`
- `server/db.js` — 2 new default rules (`container_restart`, `container_unhealthy`), `channel` column on `notification_log`
- `public/js/pages/settings.js` — full rewrite with tab-bar (General, Notifications, Notification Log, Software Update), accordion channels
- `public/js/pages/container-detail.js` — passes `timestamps` setting to `logs:subscribe`
- `public/js/pages/logs.js` — passes `timestamps` setting to `logs:subscribe`

---

## [1.8.0] - 2026-04-16

### Features
- **SMTP Email Notifications** — configure SMTP server from Settings, receive automatic email alerts when containers stop, OOM kill occurs, disk threshold exceeded, or builds fail
- **EventMonitor Service** — persistent Docker events stream listener with auto-reconnect, runs independently of frontend connections
- **Notification Rules** — per-event toggle (container_die, container_oom, disk_threshold, build_failed) with configurable cooldown (1-1440 minutes) to prevent email spam
- **Notification Log** — history of sent/failed emails viewable in Settings, auto-trimmed to 500 records
- **Test Email** — one-click SMTP test from Settings to verify configuration before relying on alerts
- **Email Templates** — professional HTML email templates for each alert type with DockGate branding

### Technical Changes
- `server/db.js` — 3 new tables: `smtp_config`, `notification_rules`, `notification_log`; 13 new prepared statements; 4 default rules on startup
- `server/notifications/mailer.js` — SMTP transport via nodemailer, sendEmail with logging, sendTestEmail
- `server/notifications/templates.js` — 5 HTML email templates (containerDie, containerOom, diskAlert, buildFail, testEmail)
- `server/notifications/event-monitor.js` — EventMonitor class: Docker events stream, throttling, disk threshold check (5min interval), auto-reconnect on stream failure
- `server/routes/settings.js` — 7 new endpoints: SMTP CRUD, test email, notification rules CRUD, notification log
- `server/index.js` — EventMonitor starts on boot, build fail triggers notification, periodic notification log trim
- `public/js/pages/settings.js` — Notifications section: SMTP form, rule toggles with cooldown, recent notifications table
- `public/js/api.js` — added `API.put()` and `API.delete()` methods
- `package.json` — added `nodemailer ^8.0.5` dependency

---

## [1.7.9] - 2026-04-16

### Features
- **Light Theme** — full light mode support with CSS custom properties, instant theme switching via `applyTheme()`, localStorage persistence for flash-free page load + server settings sync
- **Build History bulk selection & deletion** — checkbox column for both Docker Image History and Panel Builds, select-all toggle, bulk hide/delete/clear actions with confirmation dialogs
- **Container Stats UI redesign** — cleaner summary cards with separate lines for Network I/O (↓/↑) and Block I/O (R:/W:), `formatBytes()` on memory chart Y-axis, increased chart height

### Improvements
- **Chart CSS variable colors** — chart grid lines and tick labels now read from `--border` and `--text-muted` CSS variables via `getComputedStyle()`, ensuring proper rendering in both dark and light themes
- **Builds page stale render guards** — added `Router.isActiveNav()` checks after async API calls in `renderCache()`, `renderBuilders()`, and `renderBuildDetail()` to prevent stale page rendering
- **CSS hardcoded colors replaced** — all `rgba(255,255,255,...)` values across components, layout, and design-system replaced with CSS custom property references for full theme compatibility

### Technical Changes
- `public/css/design-system.css` — full `[data-theme="light"]` block with all color overrides, `--hover-bg` variable family (6 levels)
- `public/css/components.css` — buttons, tables, filters, toolbars, toggles now use CSS variables; light theme overrides for toasts, log-viewer, json-viewer, build-log-viewer, terminal-container
- `public/css/layout.css` — sidebar scrollbar, nav hover, header search, brand gradient use CSS variables
- `public/js/app.js` — `applyTheme()` function sets `data-theme` on `<html>`, boot-time theme load from localStorage
- `public/js/pages/settings.js` — theme dropdown "Light (Soon)" → "Light", calls `applyTheme()` on save
- `public/js/pages/container-detail.js` — stats summary grid layout, `formatBytes()` chart Y-axis callback, `getComputedStyle()` for chart colors
- `public/js/pages/builds.js` — `selectedPanelIds`/`selectedDockerIds` Sets, bulk action bars, navId guards on 3 async functions

---

## [1.7.8] - 2026-04-15

### Bug Fixes
- **Docker Events stream fixed** — events page was always showing "Waiting for events..." because empty `filters: {}` was passed to Docker API, blocking the stream on some Docker versions
- **Event stream cleanup** — previous event stream is now destroyed before creating a new one on re-subscribe
- **Event error handling** — added `events:error` listener on frontend to show connection errors instead of silent failure

### Technical Changes
- `server/index.js` — `events:subscribe` handler no longer passes empty filters object, destroys previous stream on re-subscribe, emits errors on stream failure
- `public/js/pages/events.js` — added `events:error` socket listener with error display in empty state

---

## [1.7.7] - 2026-04-15

### Features
- **Bulk selection & deletion — Images** — checkbox column, select-all, search, bulk remove, bulk force remove
- **Bulk selection & deletion — Volumes** — checkbox column (unused only), select-all, bulk remove with data loss warning
- **Bulk selection & deletion — Networks** — checkbox column (removable only, excludes bridge/host/none and in-use), select-all, bulk remove

### Bug Fixes
- **Navigation race condition fixed** — resolved issue where switching between pages (e.g., Images → Logs) could result in blank content or stale page rendering
- **Router navId guard** — added unique navigation ID counter to prevent in-flight async operations from overwriting the active page's content
- **All pages protected** — every page handler now checks `Router.isActiveNav()` after API calls to abort stale renders
- **Command injection fix** — compose routes now use `execFile` instead of `exec` with template literals, preventing shell injection via project names
- **WebSocket listener leak fix** — terminal `input`/`resize` listeners now cleaned up before re-registration on server side
- **Container Detail terminal resize leak** — `window.addEventListener('resize')` now properly removed in cleanup
- **Container Detail socket listener leak** — `terminal:ready` listener now tracked and removed with handler reference
- **Modal cleanup on navigation** — open modals are now closed when navigating between pages
- **Duplicate API call removed** — Containers page no longer makes a second API call just for counts
- **Toast notification limit** — max 5 toasts shown at once to prevent DOM bloat
- **Build cache prune** — uses `execFile` instead of `exec` for safer command execution
- **DB activity log retention** — activity limited to 1000 records, build history to 100, with periodic cleanup every 6h
- **DB indexes added** — indexes on `activity(resource_id, resource_type)`, `activity(created_at)`, `build_history(started_at)`
- **Compose project name validation** — only alphanumeric, dash, underscore allowed

### Technical Changes
- `public/js/router.js` — added `_navId` counter, `isActiveNav()` method, post-handler staleness check, modal cleanup on navigate
- All page handlers — added `pageNavId` capture and guard after async API calls
- `server/routes/compose.js` — replaced `exec` with `execFile`, added `validateProjectName()` and `runCompose()` helpers
- `server/db.js` — added indexes, retention cleanup on startup, `trimActivity`/`trimBuilds` prepared statements
- `server/index.js` — terminal listener cleanup before re-registration, periodic DB trim every 6h
- `server/docker.js` — `pruneBuildCache()` uses `execFile`, removed unused `exec` import
- `public/js/api.js` — toast container limited to 5 children
- `public/js/pages/containers.js` — single API call for containers + counts
- `public/js/pages/container-detail.js` — resize listener tracked in cleanup array, terminal:ready tracked with handler ref

---

## [1.7.3] - 2026-04-14

### Performance
- **Dashboard loads 3-5x faster** — removed `size:true` from `listContainers` (was forcing Docker to calculate disk usage per container)
- **Cache layer** — `getSystemInfo` (60s TTL) and `getDiskUsage` (30s TTL) results are now cached
- **Parallel stats + health** — container stats (CPU/RAM) and health inspect calls now run concurrently
- **Parallel compose projects** — `listComposeProjects` moved into Phase 1 parallel batch
- **Auto-refresh 15s → 30s** — halved Docker daemon load
- **Cache invalidation** — cache is automatically cleared after container actions

### Technical Changes
- `server/docker.js` — added `cached()` function and `invalidateCache()` utility
- `server/index.js` — dashboard endpoint restructured into 2-phase parallel architecture
- `public/js/pages/dashboard.js` — refresh interval 15000 → 30000ms

---

## [1.7.0] - 2026-04-02

### New Features
- **Enhanced Dashboard** — completely redesigned with 7 new sections
- **Container Resource Monitor** — real-time CPU and RAM usage bars for running containers
- **Network I/O** — per-container download/upload traffic overview
- **Health Status** — healthy/unhealthy/no-healthcheck counts with doughnut chart
- **Uptime & Restarts** — container uptime duration and restart count tracking
- **Port Map** — table of all exposed ports mapped to containers
- **Top Images by Size** — visual bar chart of largest Docker images
- **Quick Actions** — Start All / Stop All / Restart All buttons
- **Commit-based update detection** — every push triggers update notification, not just version changes

### Technical Changes
- `server/index.js` — dashboard API now returns containerStats, healthStats, containerDetails, portMap, topImages
- `public/js/pages/dashboard.js` — full rewrite with new sections and Chart.js doughnut
- `Dockerfile` — COMMIT_SHA build arg for update detection
- `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` — passes commit SHA to Docker build, lowercase image name fix

---

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-02

### New Features
- Version is now read from `package.json` everywhere — single source of truth
- Sidebar version display loads dynamically from `/api/meta/version` endpoint
- No more hardcoded version strings in HTML

### Technical Changes
- `server/routes/settings.js` — added `GET /meta/version` endpoint
- `public/js/app.js` — fetches version from API on boot, updates sidebar
- `public/index.html` — version placeholder replaced with dynamic loading

---

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-02

### New Features
- Auto-update system with pre-built Docker image from GHCR (GitHub Container Registry)
- One-click update: pulls new image and restarts container automatically via helper container
- Settings page "Software Update" section: version comparison, changelog, update button
- Sidebar "UPDATE" badge when new version is available
- GitHub Actions CI/CD: auto-builds and pushes Docker image on every version tag, cleans up old untagged images

### How Auto-Update Works
- **Check**: Compares local version with GitHub `package.json` via `raw.githubusercontent.com` (no rate limits)
- **Apply**: Pulls `ghcr.io/ali7zeynalli/dockgate:latest` → inspects own container config → spawns `docker:cli` helper container → helper stops old container and starts new one with same config
- **Manual**: `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`

### Technical Changes
- `server/routes/settings.js` — complete rewrite: dockerode-based image pull + helper container restart (replaces broken git-based approach)
- `docker-compose.yml` — uses pre-built GHCR image instead of local build
- `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` — CI/CD pipeline: build, push to GHCR, cleanup old images
